Today I created new repository and new branches.Then i learned and performed git commands related that repository. 
Commands I performed that are default editor finding command, help command, init, short status, ignore file (cat.gitignore), removing files (git rm file_name), moving files (git mv f1_from f2_to).
In that I faced some errors, but after some research and read in book which was provided by you online I have solved.
Then I performed log related commands. Some difficulties I faced in that but after research and solved by you in the session I competed that also.
