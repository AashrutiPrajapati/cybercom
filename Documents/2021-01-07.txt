Today I learned if there are multiple branches then how can we merge all the files of that branches. 
I got some errors in that but after research I solved it. 
I performed commands related to the merging files and also performed how to remove the files from the particular or multiple branches. 
Then I learned why we use git rebase commands and how that command differs from the merge command. 
I faced little beat difficulty to understand that difference but when you told in session then I much better understood. 
I performed git rebase, git pull rebase , got rebase continue, git remote show , git ls-remote commands. 
Then I learned how to recover the old code using checkout command. Then I learned git squash command and performed it.
