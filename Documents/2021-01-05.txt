Today I have completed Git Workflow with GitHub which was provided by you. 
In that I learned how to create repository, branch, how to generate SSH key and copied that ssh key in the github. I faced some errors in coping that key but after some research I have solved. 
Then I learned how to clone project in local machine and also I have tried basic of them. Then I performed some git commands like, remote, fetch, status, add, push, commit, merge . 
In that i faced some errors in merging command but when you solved that error in the 3 to 4 pm session then I competed that also.
That's very new things for me and that was very interesting.
