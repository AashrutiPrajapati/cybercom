Today I performed css propery like
 - height,width
 - margin
 - padding
 - image radius (for  round image)
 - display : flex, justify-content. (side by side  multiple image in html page)
 - box-shadow : 1px 2px 10px rgba()(for shadow the image or box using their x y z axis) 
 
I learned form structure using HTML. In that I learned and performed tags like lable,input, etc.
I learned why we use radio button, checkbox, for, id, name, etc.
I performed today's html practice 2 and 3.
