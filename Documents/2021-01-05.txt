today i have completed program which was provided by you. 
In that i learned how to create repository, branch,  how to generate SSH key and copied that ssh key in the github. I faced some errors in copied that key, after searching i solved. 
Then i learned how to clone project in local machine and also basic of them i tried. Then i performed some git commands like, remote, fetch, status, add, push, commit, merge . 
In that i faced some errors in merging command. but when you solved that error in the 3 to 4 pm. session then i competed that also.
That's very new things for me, & that was very interesting.
