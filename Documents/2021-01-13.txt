Today I learned 
 DOM (Data Object Manipulation) :
    -  It is a structure representation of HTML document.
    - It is use to connect webpage to script like js.
    - For each HTML box, there is an onject in the DOM that we can access and interact with.

HTML use for content and CSS use for presentation.

DOM access and manipulation 

Event : Notifications that are sent to notify the code that something happned on webpages, 
   eg., clicking button, scrolling up and down etc.

Event Listener : A function that performs action based on certain event.

I performed today's javaScript challanges.
In that I faced some error but after some research I solved it.
