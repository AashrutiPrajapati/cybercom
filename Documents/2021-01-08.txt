Today I referred Javascript videos which was send by you and performed some practicals related the video. That was useful for me. 
Then I performed some tag in html like table tag, th, td, tr, colspan, rowspan, thead, tbody, tfoot, div which are used to create table. 
I performed "&nbsp" for the white space, "br" tag for break the line.
I performed List related tags. 
Then I performed HTML practical and js code challenges  which was given by you. 
In that I faced some difficulties but after research I solved it.
