Today I learned how our code is executed . (JavaScript Parsers and Engines)
 - Execution Context and the Execution Stack.
 1. Creation Phase 
      a) Variable Object (VO)
      b) Creation of Scope Chain
      c) "This" variable
  2. Execution phase : The code of the Function that generated the current execution code is ran line by line.

 - Function and variables are hoisting in js.

 - Scoping : Each new function creates a scope.

<!DOCTYPE html> used for specifying which version of HTML the document is using. This is referred to as the document type declaration (DTD). 
 - It is very short, concise and case-insensitive.

PWA - Progressive Web Apps : Used for browser shortcut for direct open in phone.

I learned and performed js code related to Objects, Properties, Methods, Loop and Iteration in js.
